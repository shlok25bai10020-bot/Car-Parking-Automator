1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 BACKGROUND
The project addresses the need for Automated Parking System. Existing solutions have limitations, prompting this research.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
The primary problem identified is as Car Parking in various buildings like Malls, residential buildings and commercial buildings.

1.3 OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this project are:
  * To develop a working prototype.
  * To test its effectiveness.
  * To analyze the outcomes.

---------------------------------------------------

2.0 METHODOLOGY

The project was completed using the Agile methodology. Key tools used included:
  * Python programming language.
  * VS Code editor.
  * Git version control.

Data was collected via input by the user for various types like parking available, number of rows and columns required and etc.
---------------------------------------------------

3.0 IMPLEMENTATION
Implementing the Automated parking systems for various vehicle types like bike, car, truck through Python Programming and running the program.
---------------------------------------------------

4.0 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
After running the program, the result is that it enters the number of rows and columns and giving various options for vehicles types for parking removing and parking while entering the vehicle number as well.
